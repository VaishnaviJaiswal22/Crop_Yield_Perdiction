# Crop Yield Prediction using AI ðŸŒ¾
This project aims to accurately predict crop yields by analyzing various environmental and agricultural factors using AI and machine learning techniques. The goal is to support farmers and agricultural experts in making informed decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability.

# Introduction
Agricultural productivity is influenced by many factors, such as soil quality, weather conditions, and crop type. Accurate yield predictions allow farmers to optimize their farming strategies, leading to better crop management and higher yields. This project uses machine learning to predict crop yield based on historical and environmental data.

# Project Overview
The project includes:
 * Data preprocessing and analysis
 * Machine learning model training and validation
 * Yield prediction based on climate and soil data
 * Model evaluation metrics and visualization

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about:
 * Climate Data: Temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.
 * Soil Data: Soil pH, nutrients (N, P, K), moisture levels, etc.
 * Crop Data: Type of crop, historical yield data, sowing season, and growth duration.

Sample Dataset Source
You can access open-source agricultural datasets from sources like Kaggle, FAO, and Open Data to get started with data for model training.

# Model Architecture
This project employs machine learning models like:
 * Random Forest Regressor
 * Gradient Boosting
 * LogisticRegression
 * K Neighbors Classifier
 * Decision Tree Classifier

Neural Networks
The models are tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques, and feature importance analysis is conducted to understand the impact of each factor.

# Libraries Used:
 * NumPy for numerical computations
 * Pandas for data manipulation
 * Scikit-Learn for machine learning models and evaluation
 * Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
